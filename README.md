# FADC-Dataset


The Face ASD dataset for children (FADC) is a valuable resource for researchers and developers interested in facial expression recognition and the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children. The FADC dataset includes 7921 facial expression images, with 3976 instances of ASD and 3945 instances of typically developed (TD) children. The dataset is the largest of its kind, providing a robust and diverse collection of images for analysis and experimentation.

The FADC dataset was created with the goal of improving the accuracy and efficiency of facial expression recognition tools for the diagnosis of ASD in children. The dataset was carefully curated to include a wide range of facial expressions and emotions, as well as variations in lighting and facial orientation. With its large size and diverse collection of images, the FADC dataset represents a significant contribution to the field of facial expression recognition and ASD diagnosis
